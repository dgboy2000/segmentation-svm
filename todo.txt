Q. What is the value of the objective function you obtain for both the 
    loss functions ?
anchor loss: 172050.service0,84c81f130f43ce471d2385166b0bef873109db6a
9 iterations,
w=[3.6e-14 4.6e-14 2.2e-14 9.7e-14 1.5e-06 3.3e-12 6e-14], xi=0.44
objective SVM = 0.435556019059
objective RW = 3.858242829405135e-09

one prior, one laplacian
w=[6.6e-15 1.5e-06], xi=0.44
objective RW = 1.89e-10 

laplacian loss: 172060.service0, f050805eea0411b98be38ab8597a6506ee0b40ee
9 iterations,
w=[1.6e-14 1.9e-14 1.1e-14 3.1e-14 3.4e-06 8.8e-13 1.9e-14], xi=0.78
objective SVM = 0.77931789261
objective RW = 1.6446765784077383e-09

if one prior, one laplacian:
w=[1.36e-14 2.52e-06]
objective RW = 3.9e-10

Q. a*w0 is within the feasible region of the optimization problem.
    value of the objective for different values of a ?

Q. results when the regularization term is a simple square of L2 norm ?

Q. what is the value of the loss augmented objective with the laplacian loss
     if L and anchor are zero ?
A. it is the uniform probability 1/nlabel

Q. What values for RW + prior objective if L=0 ? x = x0 ? (first iteration)
A. yes

Q. (first iteration) w should be exactly 0. With the rescaling of psi, 
    it is not.
A. results are different when forcing w and xi to be exactly 0 at the 
    first iteration:
without: w=[2.3e-14 1.8e-07], xi=0.041, in 8 iterations, objective=0.0410947915456
with:    w=[2.9e-15 2.2e-07], xi=0.041, in 10 iterations, objective=0.0410524308538


- debug convergence of ACI
idea: test log-barrier with constraints Gx > -inf. Should be equiv. to 
    no constraints.

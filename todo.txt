- debug svm_struct with / without mosek
Q. What values for RW + prior objective if L=0 ? x = x0 ? (first iteration)
Q. (first iteration) w should be exactly 0. With the rescaling of psi, it is not.

- debug convergence of ACI
idea: test log-barrier with constraints Gx > -inf. Should be equiv. to no constraints.

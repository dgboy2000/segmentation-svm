Q. What is the value of the objective function you obtain for both the 
    loss functions ?
anchor loss: 172009.service0,6b1d69003dc8b43fd878bfeeb773960c3c92f940
laplacian loss: TODO 

Q. a*w0 is within the feasible region of the optimization problem.
    value of the objective for different values of a ?

Q. results when the regularization term is a simple square of L2 norm ?

Q. what is the value of the loss augmented objective with the laplacian loss
     is L and anchor are zero ?
A. it is the uniform probability 1/nlabel

Q. What values for RW + prior objective if L=0 ? x = x0 ? (first iteration)
A. yes

Q. (first iteration) w should be exactly 0. With the rescaling of psi, 
    it is not.
A. results are different when forcing w and xi to be exactly 0 at the 
    first iteration:
without: w=[2.3e-14 1.8e-07], xi=0.041, in 8 iterations, objective=0.0410947915456
with:    w=[2.9e-15 2.2e-07], xi=0.041, in 10 iterations, objective=0.0410524308538

idea: test log-barrier with constraints Gx > -inf. Should be equiv. to 
    no constraints.

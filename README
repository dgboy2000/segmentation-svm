To get this code working on a new machine:

1. Install the Enthought Python Distribution
2. Install Install MOSEK and its python API
3. Make sure openmpi is installed (so mpirun command is recognized)
4. Install mpi4py module
5. Add the data and output directories for your machine to config.py 


Here is a sample .profile file that properly prepares the environment for a run:

# For research purposes, use locally-installed software
LOCAL=$HOME/local
export PATH=$PATH:$LOCAL/git/bin
export PATH=$LOCAL/epd-7.3-2-rh5-x86_64/bin:$PATH
export MOSEKHOME=$LOCAL/mosek
export MOSEKLM_LICENSE_FILE=$MOSEKHOME/6/licenses
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$MOSEKHOME/6/tools/platform/linux64x86/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$LOCAL/openmpi-1.6.1/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LOCAL/openmpi-1.6.1/lib
